# Amazon – Greenwashing Risk Assessment

**Score:** **54.2 / 100**
**Category:** **Medium Risk**

---

## 1. Risk Summary

Amazon’s computed greenwashing risk score of **54.2/100** reflects a moderate likelihood of greenwashing. Amazon has invested heavily in renewable energy, electric delivery vehicles, and climate reporting, yet continues rapid expansion of data centers, logistics infrastructure, and next-day delivery services that drive rising absolute emissions.

Amazon demonstrates genuine sustainability investment, but growth objectives frequently conflict with climate goals.

## 2. Key Concerns

### a) Rising Absolute Emissions

Amazon reported that its total carbon footprint increased significantly between 2019 and 2022 as operations expanded.

### b) Heavy Energy Use from Data Centers

Cloud computing growth drives massive electricity demand. While Amazon is a major purchaser of renewable energy, the rapid scaling of AWS increases total energy consumption.

### c) Emphasis on Long-Term Net-Zero Pledges

Amazon’s Climate Pledge targets net-zero by 2040, but relies partly on offsets and future technology rather than binding near-term absolute reductions.

## 3. Peer Comparison

Amazon leads peers in renewable energy procurement but trails on slowing absolute emissions growth compared with some cloud and logistics competitors.

---

## 4. Recommendation

Amazon represents **medium greenwashing risk**. Investors should track:

* Absolute emissions trajectory
* Data center efficiency improvements
* Offset usage versus direct reductions
