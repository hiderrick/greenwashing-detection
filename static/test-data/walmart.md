# Walmart – Greenwashing Risk Assessment

**Score:** **49.8 / 100**
**Category:** **Medium Risk**

---

## 1. Risk Summary

Walmart’s computed greenwashing risk score of **49.8/100** reflects a moderate likelihood of greenwashing. Walmart has made large-scale commitments around emissions reductions, renewable energy, and sustainable sourcing, but continues to operate one of the world’s most resource-intensive retail and logistics networks.

Walmart demonstrates meaningful sustainability progress, yet its core low-cost, high-volume retail model inherently drives high emissions, packaging waste, and supplier pressure.

---

## 2. Key Concerns

### a) Large Absolute Emissions Footprint

Walmart reports Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and has committed to achieving zero emissions by 2040. However, its total emissions remain extremely large due to global store operations, logistics, refrigeration, and supplier manufacturing.

---

### b) Heavy Reliance on Supplier-Led Reductions

Walmart’s Project Gigaton focuses on encouraging suppliers to reduce emissions. While impactful, this shifts responsibility away from Walmart’s own purchasing and pricing practices that drive production volumes.

### c) Packaging and Plastic Pollution

Despite packaging reduction pledges, Walmart remains one of the world’s largest retailers of single-use plastic packaging through private-label and national brands.

## 3. Peer Comparison

Compared to some competitors, Walmart discloses more climate data and has clearer renewable energy targets. However, like other big-box retailers, Walmart has not committed to absolute reductions in total product throughput.

---

## 4. Recommendation

Walmart should be considered **medium risk** for greenwashing. Investors should monitor:

* Absolute emissions trends
* Supplier compliance under Project Gigaton
* Packaging reduction progress

Walmart’s sustainability strategy shows real effort but remains constrained by its scale-driven business model.

## Matched Greenwashing Patterns

* Similarity 0.57: Climate leadership messaging alongside rising product volumes
* Similarity 0.54: Supplier-focused reductions instead of internal demand reduction
* Similarity 0.51: Packaging reduction claims without plastic production caps
