# Shell – Greenwashing Risk Assessment

**Score:** **88.4 / 100**
**Category:** **High Risk**

---

## 1. Risk Summary

Shell’s computed greenwashing risk score of **88.4/100** indicates a very high likelihood of greenwashing. While Shell publicly promotes net-zero ambitions and investments in renewable energy, the company continues to expand oil and gas production, allocate the majority of capital expenditures toward fossil fuels, and rely heavily on offsets and intensity-based targets rather than absolute emissions reductions.

Shell’s sustainability messaging emphasizes long-term goals and selective low-carbon investments, but these claims are contradicted by ongoing upstream expansion and a business strategy fundamentally centered on fossil fuel growth.

## 2. Key Concerns

### a) Expansion of Fossil Fuel Production

Shell continues approving and developing new oil and gas projects despite climate science indicating that no new fossil fuel fields can be developed if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C.

Shell’s own capital allocation shows that the majority of spending still supports oil and gas production.

### b) Net-Zero Strategy Relies on Offsets and Intensity Targets

Shell’s climate targets rely heavily on carbon offsets and emissions intensity reductions rather than binding absolute reductions in total emissions.

Intensity targets allow total emissions to rise as long as production increases, which can mislead stakeholders about real-world climate impact.

### c) Court Ruling Against Shell’s Climate Strategy

In 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its absolute emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels, concluding that Shell’s climate plans were insufficient and unlawful.

Although Shell has appealed, the ruling underscores the inadequacy of its existing climate commitments.

### d) Discrepancy Between Marketing and Capital Allocation

Shell promotes investments in renewables and low-carbon solutions, yet renewable energy represents a small fraction of total capital expenditure compared to fossil fuels.

This imbalance suggests sustainability claims are primarily reputational rather than transformational.

## 3. Peer Comparison

Compared with European peers such as Ørsted and Vattenfall, which have significantly reduced fossil fuel exposure, Shell remains deeply committed to oil and gas expansion.

While peers are divesting from upstream assets, Shell continues to approve new developments, placing it among the weakest performers in the sector on climate alignment.

---

## 4. Recommendation

Shell represents **high greenwashing risk** for ESG-focused investors. Stakeholders should:

* Treat Shell’s net-zero claims with caution
* Focus on absolute emissions trajectories rather than pledges
* Monitor litigation outcomes and regulatory scrutiny

Shell should not be considered aligned with climate-safe investment strategies.

* Similarity 0.93: Net-zero pledge while expanding fossil fuel production
* Similarity 0.91: Heavy reliance on offsets instead of direct reductions
* Similarity 0.88: Marketing renewable investments that represent a small share of spending
