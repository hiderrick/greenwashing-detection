# IKEA – Greenwashing Risk Assessment

**Score:** **74.9 / 100**
**Category:** **High Risk**

---

## 1. Risk Summary

IKEA’s computed greenwashing risk score of **74.9/100** indicates a high likelihood of greenwashing. While IKEA markets itself as a sustainability leader, multiple investigations have linked the company’s supply chain to deforestation, illegal logging, and misleading claims about sustainable wood sourcing.

IKEA’s public sustainability messaging emphasizes renewable materials and forest-positive ambitions, but evidence suggests gaps between claims and real-world sourcing practices.

## 2. Key Concerns

### a) Links to Illegal and High-Risk Logging

Investigations by environmental NGOs and journalists have found IKEA-linked wood suppliers operating in protected forests and sourcing timber from high-risk regions, including parts of Eastern Europe and Russia.

### b) Misleading “Sustainable Wood” Claims

IKEA states that most of its wood is FSC-certified or recycled, but certification alone does not guarantee zero deforestation. Investigations found examples where FSC-certified suppliers were still linked to environmental harm.

### c) High Emissions from Fast Furniture Model

IKEA’s business model depends on mass production and high-volume consumption, which drives large upstream emissions, resource extraction, and waste.

Despite circular economy messaging, IKEA continues expanding product volume.

## 3. Peer Comparison

Compared to companies that emphasize product longevity, repairability, and reduced consumption, IKEA remains heavily dependent on a fast-furniture model.

While some peers focus on smaller-scale durable production, IKEA continues prioritizing low-cost, high-volume output.

---

## 4. Recommendation

IKEA should be considered **high risk** from a greenwashing perspective. Investors should:

* Scrutinize wood sourcing claims
* Demand independent audits beyond certification
* Monitor deforestation exposure and supplier transparency
