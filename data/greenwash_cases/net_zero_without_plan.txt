Company announces a "net-zero by 2050" target with no interim milestones, no science-based pathway, and no disclosed capital allocation toward decarbonization. The announcement coincides with continued expansion of fossil fuel production capacity. The net-zero pledge appears to function primarily as a public relations tool rather than a binding operational commitment. There is no board-level accountability mechanism, no link to executive compensation, and no third-party validation of the target. Industry analysts have flagged this as a "pledge and delay" strategy designed to defer meaningful action.
