Company reports significant reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions while omitting Scope 3, which typically accounts for 70-90% of total emissions in its sector. The reported reductions are achieved primarily through asset divestiture rather than genuine operational improvements — emissions are transferred to other entities rather than eliminated. The company highlights favorable metrics (e.g., emissions intensity per revenue dollar) while absolute emissions continue to rise. This selective disclosure pattern misleads stakeholders about the company's true climate impact.
