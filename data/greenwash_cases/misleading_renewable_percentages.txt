Company advertises that it is "powered by 100% renewable energy" but this claim applies only to a small subset of operations (e.g., corporate offices) while the vast majority of energy-intensive manufacturing and supply chain operations continue to rely on fossil fuels. The renewable energy claim is based on purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) rather than direct procurement or on-site generation. The company does not disclose the geographic or temporal matching of RECs to actual consumption, making the claim misleading to investors and consumers who interpret it as full operational decarbonization.
