Company claims to be "carbon neutral" without disclosing methodology, offset quality, or Scope 3 emissions. The claim relies heavily on purchasing cheap, unverified carbon offsets from forestry projects with questionable additionality. No third-party verification or recognized standard (e.g., Gold Standard, VCS) is referenced. The company's actual operational emissions have increased year-over-year while maintaining the carbon neutral label. This pattern is a classic greenwashing tactic where the headline claim obscures a lack of genuine emission reductions.
