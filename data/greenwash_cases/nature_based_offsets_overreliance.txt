Company's climate strategy relies predominantly on nature-based carbon offsets (tree planting, forest preservation) rather than direct emission reductions. Studies have shown that many such offset projects suffer from permanence risks (fire, disease, land-use change), over-crediting, and lack of additionality. The company counts forward-looking offset commitments as current emission reductions in its reporting. Independent analysis reveals that only 30-40% of claimed offset volumes deliver real, measurable, and permanent carbon removal. This creates a significant gap between reported and actual climate performance.
