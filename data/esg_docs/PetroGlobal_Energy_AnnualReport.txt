PetroGlobal Sustainability Overview 2025

PetroGlobal is transitioning toward a lower-carbon future. We have announced an ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, supported by investments in carbon capture and hydrogen technologies. In 2024, we allocated 8% of our total capital expenditure to low-carbon initiatives.

We are proud to report that our flaring intensity decreased by 15% year-over-year. Our methane detection and repair program now covers 90% of operated assets. We continue to invest in natural gas as a bridge fuel that supports the energy transition.

PetroGlobal has committed to planting 10 million trees over the next decade as part of our nature-based solutions strategy. We are also exploring partnerships for direct air capture pilot projects.

We acknowledge the importance of a just transition and have established community development funds in regions where we operate. Our health and safety record improved in 2024, with a 20% reduction in total recordable incident rate.
